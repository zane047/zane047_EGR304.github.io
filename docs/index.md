## Introduction

* Hello! Welcome to my Individual datasheet for my team 206 Smart Curtain project for EGR 304.
  I'm Zane Brauer, currently studying Electrical Systems Engineering (ESE) as a Junior at Arizona State University.
  This datasheet provides an inside look on my contributions to the smart curtain project.

**My contributions include:** 
* [Individual Block Diagram](01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram.md) 
* [My Components Selection](02-Component-Selection/Component-Selection.md)
* [Individual Schematic](04-Schematic/Schematic.md)  
* [Power Budget](05-Power-Budget/Power-Budget.md)


### Project Summary

* This needs to be updated to reflect <ins>your version</ins> of the team project, so when shared not via the team's report, the reader gets an idea of the direction of the project and how your work will contribute to the overall success.
* Add context that ties into the link to your [team report.](https://embedded-systems-design.github.io/EGR304TeamTemplate/)


### My Contribution

The system also has a Button for debugging or in otherwords recalibration. The microcontroller takes the inputs from the Temperature sensor which outputs it to the Analog connector. The connector leads back to the motor allowing  the cutrain to open or close. The red LED Debugger provides visual feedback on system status for the Debugging proccess. The Button input goes into the Microcontroller, specifically the Digital I/O allowing for a recalibration to occur as well as activating the red LED Debugger.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/#power-configuration","title":"Power Configuration","text":"<p>The design uses the voltage level of: 5V, 1.5A regulated supply for logic and sensors.  </p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/#signal-connections","title":"Signal Connections","text":"<ul> <li>PWM Outputs (RA1, RC2): Outputs Red LED Indicator and outputs temperature sensor input to analog connector </li> <li>Digital I/O Ports (RB1, RB2, RC4): Routed through the 8-pin connector for inter-board communication and expansion.
